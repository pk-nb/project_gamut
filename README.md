# Project Gamut

This is a two-player, hexagon-grid game, where the objective is to occupy the most space on the board. Pieces cost points to play, which  are replenished by money-generating hexagons.

Uses the socket.io library and snap.svg (currently dev branch of  12/4).

TODO: Implement unit tests via Jasmine or QUnit, rework internal API
